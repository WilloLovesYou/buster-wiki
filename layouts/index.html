      <h3><strong>Belief #1:</strong> I believe that polarization is our greatest current existential threat.</h3>
      <blockquote><h4>The easiest thing we can do to address this immediately is to commit to <mark><a href="/book">having more productive disagreements</a></mark>. Then next time you find yourself in a frustrating disagreement that's going nowhere, ask the other person: "Is this about what you think is true, what you think is meaningful, or what you think is useful?" Listen, then answer for yourself as well. Once you can agree at this level then you're on your way.</h4></blockquote>

Since I have vast blind spots, I want to always be open to perspectives and evidence that could help me see things more clearly. If you think I'm wrong about something, please tell me. If I can help you see something from a different perspective, reach out.</h4></blockquote>

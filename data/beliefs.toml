[[world.civilization]]
desc = "As history progresses, power will tend to be more quickly redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top."

[[world.civilization]]
desc = "When power is redistributed (through disruption, revolution, or disaster), it will have undesirable short-term consequences."

[[world.civilization]]
desc = "Being good/moral increasingly becomes our default state as we learn more about the world and are more connected with others."

[[world.civilization]]
desc = "Power often becomes motivated to remain in power, which results in systemic discrimination, harrassment, and abuse. It is against power's first-order objectives to build structures that might lead to them being removed from power, but as awareness of this dynamic increases, so should accountability. It will be a very slow uphill battle with many movements backwards, but all the more reason to always push on increasing awareness and accountability within all systems."

[[life.aliens]]
desc = "Non-carbon-based life forms exist."

[[life.aliens]]
desc = "Aliens exist, but for the same reaon most sci-fi adopts faster-than-light travel, cryogenics, and wormholes to facilitate travel, humans and physics as we currently understand them are not going to make this easy. More likely, I think we will discover their creations (ie. long-lived, patient robots they made) before we discover their biological species."

[[life.aliens]]
desc = "Aliens will probably discover our own long-lived, patient robots before they discover us."

[[life.aliens]]
desc = "The vast majority of intelligent beings throughout the universe are probably more similar to robots and cyborgs than organically evolved life."

[[life.aliens]]
desc = "Aliens are unlikely to be aggressive. Any sufficient reason to come specifically to us is unlikely to be motivated by typical warlike intentions, because we don't have anything special in the universe that they can't get elsewhere for cheaper."

desc = "Most questions have no answer (but asking them and talking about them anyway is often entertaining)."

[[philosophy.truth]]
desc = "I subscribe to Hume's Fork, which claims that there are two kinds of knowledge: matters of fact, and relations of ideas. Matters of fact aren’t accessible to us—we can never know something for certain, only that it hasn't been proven wrong yet. We can only create a self-referencing network of ideas that are related to each other. '2 + 2 = 4' and 'My name is Buster' are both conclusively true if we agree to the definitions and relations between each word and symbol."

[[policy.gun-control]]
desc = "Owning a gun should require certification and licensing from a firearms officer verifying that they've taken a safety course, are free of criminal record, and pass a psychological mental health check every few years. The licenses should expire every couple years and require re-testing."

[[policy.free-speech]]
desc = "Speech is a form of power, and just like power, free speech has constraints and is never absolute. However, because speech is often regulated by those in power, it's important to make sure they are not in charge or even capable of determining the constraints of free speech."

[[psychology.bias]]
desc = "We have many implicit associations that lead to bias."

[[psychology.bias]]
desc = "We're susceptible to many cognitive biases and logical fallacies, because our brains require them to get any thinking done within our constraints of time and energy."

[[psychology.mindfulness]]
desc = "Prayer is useful as a mental maintenance tool, but doesn't tap into any special lines of communication to powerful beings."

[[psychology.mindfulness]]
desc = "For beginners, private journaling and going on a long walk are both better than sitting on a pillow and trying not to think (aka meditating) or talking to an imaginary omniscient being (aka prayer)."

[[psychology.tulpa]]
desc = "Tulpa are super weird, but extremely fascinating as a concept."

[[psychology.tulpa]]
desc = "'Tulpa' is a term that refers to our internal thoughtforms of conscious entities. For example, while Santa may not exist in the real world, we all have an internal tulpa of Santa that we've trained to essentially simulate Santa in our minds. Tulpa can exist for living people, dead people, historical people, and even our concept of ourselves is a tulpa in some ways."

[[technology.artificial-intelligence]]
desc = "Intelligence isn't a single skill that can be acquired all at once, but the result of learning processes that take in one or more flows of new information, and communicate out analysis of the data in meaningful ways. Every flow of data will favor different intelligences, and intelligences that exist on one or more flows of data won't necessarily be adapted for other flows of data."

My favorite habit from this book is habit 5: [seek first to understand, then to be understood](https://www.franklincovey.com/the-7-habits/habit-5.html). Stephen Covey seemed to also share this favorite:

> "If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important principle I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations, it would be this: Seek first to understand, then to be understood." -- Stephen Covey

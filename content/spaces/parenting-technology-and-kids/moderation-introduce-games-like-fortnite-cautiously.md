Kellianne [asked a question on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10155694360576109&set=a.10150453244796109&type=3&theater) (protected) specifically about whether or not we should let Niko (8 years old) play Fortnite. It sparked this discussion which touches on many issues around parenting, technology, and kids.

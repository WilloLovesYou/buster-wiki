#### The case
Technology and screens are not intrinsically good or bad, any more than playing sports or reading books or becoming obsessed with Disney princesses are. The reason technology and screens get picked out of the crowd is because it's new, unfamiliar territory for our culture, and older generations are always threatened by the inventions of newer generations. The temptation to point a finger at a new thing and call it a threat doesn't immediately invalidate the possibility that it's also true, of course, but it puts it into the "extraordinary proof" category of claims. 

Studies are underway that could prove this case invalid (see "Is Screen Time Bad For Our Kids" for one such study). But so far, evidence is not in favor of technology and screen time being a harmful influence on kids or adults.

In the meantime, we can and should continue to take a keen interest in our primary responsibility as parents to foster a diverse and ever-growing set of healthy interests in our children that all together lead to a thriving little human.

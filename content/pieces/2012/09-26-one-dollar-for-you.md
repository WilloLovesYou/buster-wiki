I want to change some of my behaviors. What else is new, right? (I'll tell you what is new!) I have a **new strategy** for getting through my habit-gimmick-resistant brain. 

Between now and the end of October, I'll give $1 to the first person who calls me out at any time if they witness me doing any of the following:

1. Complaining about anything. Anything! Complaining is stupid.
2. Talking ill about anyone behind their back. Gossipping.
3. Eating junk food, drinking soda.
4. Drinking anything alcoholic except red wine.

2 social habits, 2 health habits: a good start for now. I might edit or add as I go along.

I'm planning to use [Chirpify](http://chirpify.com/busterbenson) to pay people, since I've been wanting to use their service, and like how it automatically adds a public element to the self-challenge. So anyone on Twitter or the internet at large can feel free to call me out whenever!

Please, call me out!

Also, if you want me to call **you** out on anything, let me know!  It can be a thing we do. Ready?

It's on!

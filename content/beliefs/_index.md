### What are beliefs?

A belief is a personal perspective constructed out of pieces of information and experiences that we have. The believe can be a perspective on anything from "what is the best burrito in SF?" to "how did the universe begin and how will it end?" to "how easy should it be to buy a gun?" and beyond.

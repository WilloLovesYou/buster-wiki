A <mark>pile</mark> is a disorganized set of articles, books, ideas, podcasts, quotes, and other things that match a particular interest of mine. They have more weight than a single link, but haven't yet formed into well-defined <mark><a href="/beliefs">beliefs</a></mark> or <mark><a href="/projects">projects</a></mark>.

The birds made regular day trips to hundreds of trees in the area, many of which were on the mountain. One generous bird offered to take her on a full tour. The next day they took off. They flew for several hours. It was a hot day, and the wind was against them. As they got closer, the bird's stomach grumbled and her wings started flapping slower. She asked if Clodia particularly liked being an acorn, or if she would be interested in being eaten and turned into bird energy to fly a bit farther today.

If you think Clodia should offer herself as energy to help the bird keep flying, go to [page 31]({{< ref "031.md" >}}).

If you think Clodia should not get eaten, go to [page 32]({{< ref "032.md" >}}).

The hint of infinite possibilities quickly faded as the acorn sat under the tree for a couple days, unnoticed. But then! Just as the last drop of hope evaporated into the late summer sky, a wide-eyed flapping creature of enormous size offered her assistance. When Clodia asked the bird about the mountain and if she could take Clodia there, she replied, “That old mountain? I fly over it every day!”

If you think Clodia should accept the bird’s help, go to [page 28]({{< ref "028.md" >}}).

If you think Clodia should say no thanks, go to [page 33]({{< ref "033.md" >}}).
